"""Streamlit UI for the Beall's List predatory-venue check.

Launch from the repo root (with the venv active):

    streamlit run ui/app.py

or just run ``run_ui.ps1`` / ``run_ui.sh``.

Paste or upload Semantic Scholar paper records (each with a ``publicationVenue``),
choose the fast (rules-only) or thorough (rules + an LLM pass over the "review"
papers) check, run it, preview the result, and download the Excel.  The UI runs
the same scripts as the command line, so the output is identical.

The app has two pages, listed in the sidebar: **Run a check** (the four-step flow
below) and **Tutorial**, which renders ``ui/TUTORIAL.md`` — the same walkthrough

# not a rounding error.  Measured on a 60 MB, 18,482-paper export, one keystroke
# in Step 3's venue box cost 0.9s to decode and parse, 7.5s to validate and 3.1s
# to build the quality workbook — 11.5s of script run, against 0.25s with
# nothing loaded.  For all of it Streamlit holds every element it has not
# redrawn yet at its stale opacity (0.33, after a 0.5s delay), which is why
# everything below Step 2 went dim and stayed dim for as long as anyone typed.
#
# So the corpus is now identified rather than re-derived: *token* names which
# corpus this is — the uploader's own file id, or a digest of the pasted text —
# and the three expensive steps are keyed on it.  A rerun that changes neither
# does no work at all.
#
# ``cache_resource`` and not ``cache_data``, for the reason ``doaj_index`` gives:
# cache_data serialises its value and hands back a copy on every access, and a
